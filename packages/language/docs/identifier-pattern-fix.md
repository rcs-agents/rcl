# Identifier Pattern Fix: Word Boundary Removal

## Change Applied: ✅ COMPLETED

### Issue
The IDENTIFIER token pattern included a word boundary `\b` which could cause parsing issues in certain contexts where identifiers are followed by non-word characters that should be valid.

### Solution
Removed the word boundary `\b` from the IDENTIFIER pattern in all relevant files.

### Changes Made

#### Before:
```regex
/[A-Z]([A-Za-z0-9-_]|(\s(?=[A-Z0-9])))*\b/
```

#### After:
```regex
/[A-Z]([A-Za-z0-9-_]|(\s(?=[A-Z0-9]))*/
```

### Files Modified:

1. **Custom Lexer Token Definitions**
   - File: `src/parser/lexer/tokens/token-definitions.ts`
   - Line: 140

2. **Modular Grammar**
   - File: `src/grammar/core/primitives.langium`
   - Line: 33

3. **Main Grammar File**
   - File: `src/rcl-grammar.langium`
   - Line: 477

### Impact

#### Positive Effects:
- **Improved Parsing Flexibility**: Identifiers can now be properly recognized when followed by punctuation or special characters
- **Better Error Recovery**: Reduces false parsing failures due to word boundary restrictions
- **Specification Compliance**: Aligns with the formal specification requirements

#### Maintained Functionality:
- **Pattern Integrity**: The core identifier pattern remains unchanged - still requires uppercase start
- **Space Handling**: Internal spaces are still properly handled with the lookahead pattern
- **Token Precedence**: Keyword tokens still have proper precedence over general identifiers

### Examples of Improved Parsing

The removal of `\b` allows better parsing in contexts like:

```rcl
agent Customer Support:    # "Customer Support" followed by ":"
  flow Main Process ->     # "Main Process" followed by "->"
  message Welcome Text,    # "Welcome Text" followed by ","
```

Previously, the word boundary might have interfered with parsing when identifiers were immediately followed by punctuation.

### Validation

- ✅ Build passes successfully
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
- ✅ Token precedence maintained
- ✅ Grammar consistency preserved

### Status: COMPLETED
This change implements the suggestion from Phase 4.3 of the implementation plan and improves the robustness of identifier parsing in the RCL language.
