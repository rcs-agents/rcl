# Rule Reference Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the ability to use direct rule references in `patterns` properties, which are automatically converted to `{ include: "#[RULE_KEY]" }` statements during grammar generation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Type System Updates (`packages/tmgrammar-toolkit/src/types.ts`)

```typescript
// Updated RulePatterns to accept Pattern[] instead of Rule[]
export interface RulePatterns {
  patterns: Pattern[];
}

// New Pattern type that allows rule references
export type Pattern = Rule | RuleReference | BasicIncludePattern;

// RuleReference type for direct rule usage
export type RuleReference = MatchRule | BeginEndRule | IncludeRule;
```

### 2. Emit Logic Updates (`packages/tmgrammar-toolkit/src/emit.ts`)

- Updated `processPatterns` function to handle `Pattern[]` instead of `Rule[]`
- Added logic to detect rule references and convert them to include statements
- Maintained support for existing `BasicIncludePattern` usage
- Added proper error handling for circular dependencies and key collisions

### 3. Scope System Enhancements (`packages/tmgrammar-toolkit/src/scopes/punctuation.ts`)

Added template literal support scopes:

```typescript
'template-string': ScopeTree<'template-string', {
  begin: Scope<'begin'>;
  end: Scope<'end'>;
}>;
'template-expression': ScopeTree<'template-expression', {
  begin: Scope<'begin'>;
  end: Scope<'end'>;
}>;
```

### 4. Example Implementation (`packages/tmgrammar-toolkit/tests/fixtures/grammar-comparison/bicep.ts`)

Demonstrated mixed usage patterns:

```typescript
// Before: Manual include strings
patterns: [
  { include: '#line-comment' },
  { include: '#block-comment' }
]

// After: Direct rule references  
patterns: [
  lineComment,
  blockComment
]

// Mixed usage is also supported
patterns: [
  identifier,                    // Rule reference
  { include: '#expression' },    // Include string (for circular deps)
  comments                       // Rule reference
]
```

## Key Features

### ✅ Direct Rule References
```typescript
const comments: IncludeRule = {
  key: 'comments',
  patterns: [
    lineComment,     // ← Direct rule reference
    blockComment     // ← Direct rule reference
  ]
};
```

### ✅ Automatic Conversion
During emit, rule references are automatically converted to:
```json
{
  "patterns": [
    { "include": "#line-comment" },
    { "include": "#block-comment" }
  ]
}
```

### ✅ Mixed Usage Support
You can mix rule references with traditional include patterns:
```typescript
patterns: [
  ruleReference,              // Direct reference
  { include: '#other-rule' }, // Traditional include
  anotherRuleReference        // Another direct reference
]
```

### ✅ Circular Dependency Handling
The system gracefully handles circular dependencies by:
- Detecting when rules reference each other
- Providing warnings for better debugging
- Supporting fallback to traditional include patterns when needed

### ✅ Type Safety
Full TypeScript support with:
- Proper type checking for rule references
- IntelliSense support for available rules
- Compile-time validation of pattern structures

## Benefits

1. **Improved Developer Experience**: No need to manually write include strings
2. **Better Refactoring**: IDE refactoring tools work with direct references
3. **Type Safety**: Compile-time checking prevents typos in rule names
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing grammars continue to work unchanged
5. **Flexible Usage**: Can mix direct references with traditional includes as needed

## Usage Guidelines

### ✅ Good Uses for Rule References
- Simple, non-circular rule inclusions
- Frequently referenced utility rules
- Clear, readable pattern definitions

### ⚠️ When to Use Include Strings
- Circular dependencies (rule A includes rule B, which includes rule A)
- Dynamic rule references
- Legacy compatibility requirements

## Testing

All existing tests pass, confirming:
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained
- ✅ Grammar generation produces correct output
- ✅ Repository structure remains valid
- ✅ Complex grammar examples work correctly
- ✅ No performance regressions

The implementation successfully enhances the tmgrammar-toolkit while maintaining full compatibility with existing code.
